# EDUFund Contracts Backend

It uses hardhat as the contract development framework.

It contains majorly three contract files:

- `contracts/EDUFund.sol`: The main contract file.
- `contracts/Errors.sol`: The error codes for the contract.
- `contracts/Events.sol`: The events for the contract.

## Some other important files to note

- `scripts/deploy.js`: The deployment script.
- `scripts/restoreState.ts`: This script is used after deployment of the contract using previous file (deploy.js). It is used for following task:
